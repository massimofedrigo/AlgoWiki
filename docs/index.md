# Welcome to AlgoWiki 👋

**AlgoWiki** is an open-source collection of algorithms and data structures, implemented in **C++** and analyzed with a focus on computational complexity.

The goal is to provide clear explanations, rigorous mathematical analysis (powered by $\LaTeX$), and modern implementations.

---

## 🚀 Available Algorithms

Currently, the repository includes the following implementations:

### Sorting

* [**Bubble Sort**](bubble_sort.md) - A simple (though inefficient) sorting algorithm.
* [**Merge Sort**](merge_sort.md) - An efficient, stable algorithm based on the *Divide and Conquer* paradigm.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This documentation is built using:

* **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: Static site generator.
* **[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)**: The graphical theme.
* **MathJax**: For rendering mathematical formulas.
